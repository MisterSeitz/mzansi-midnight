# Mzansi Midnight (`eThekwini-Gold`) — Project Context & Architecture

## Overview
**Mzansi Midnight** is an episodic, connected **5-part Dice-and-Node Noir RPG anthology** inspired by *Citizen Sleeper* and *Disco Elysium*, mapping the systemic anatomy of South African state capture, resource cartels, and political conspiracy across five regional crucibles:
1. **Story 1: eThekwini-Gold** (*The Coastal Gateway* — Durban Port & Precursor Convoys, Docket #409) [LIVE]
2. **Story 2: Highveld-Chrome** (*The Capital Syndicate* — Joburg Grid Sabotage & Gold Reefs, Case File #711-GP) [LIVE]
3. **Story 3: Namaqua-Diamond** (*The Desert Skeleton Coast* — Richtersveld Dredging & Arms Corridors) [LIVE]
4. **Story 4: Cape-Nocturne** (*The Shadow Oligarchy* — Table Mountain Nightlife & Gang Federations) [LIVE]
5. **Story 5: The Sovereign Octagon** (*The Grand National Finale* — Drakensberg Bunker & Union Buildings) [LIVE]

Each story is locked until the player unlocks the preceding story by achieving a viable campaign ending and securing the chapter's **Keystone Dossier**. Complete story bible and progression specifications are detailed in [`STORIES.md`](file:///c:/Users/Faiz/Documents/workspaces/mzansi-midnight/STORIES.md).

In **Story 1: eThekwini-Gold**, players take on the role of a suspended Hawks (DPCI) Warrant Officer surviving out of a generator-powered flat in the Mercury Arcade who is thrust into a conspiracy involving **Docket #409**—a R400 million municipal water-tanker tender secretly used to transport liquid chemical precursors from Pier 2 for methamphetamine super-labs.

## Core Gameplay Pillars

1. **Daily Action Dice & Composure**:
   - At the start of each Cycle (Day), the player rolls 3 to 5 six-sided dice (`d6`) based on their **Composure** (`80–100%` = 5 dice, `40–79%` = 4 dice, `<40%` = 3 dice).
   - **Dragging or clicking** a die onto a Map Node's **Action Slot** resolves deterministically using:
     $$\text{Final Roll} = \text{Die Value} + \text{Stat Modifier} + \text{Stage 6 Blackout Modifier} + \text{Hostile Turf Penalty}$$
   - **Outcome Tiers** (with full 3-tier mechanical preview on every slot card):
     - `6+`: **Clean Success** (+2 clock progress, high rewards, zero trace)
     - `4–5`: **Compromised Success** (+1 clock progress, minor Composure or Heat cost)
     - `1–3`: **Failure / Blowback** (Composure loss, Precinct Heat, or threat clock advancement)

2. **Four Investigator Stats (`-1` to `+3+`) & Black-Market Gear**:
   - `street`: Force, intimidation, taxi rank politics, surviving ambushes, covert physical recon.
   - `dockets`: Forensic accounting, municipal registry audits, court clerks, certified evidence.
   - `wire`: Signals intelligence, bypassing biometric locks, cloning SAPS radio transponders.
   - `influence`: Inside game, bribing precinct clerks, tapping driver networks, political blackmail.
   - **Field Hardware Upgrades**: Players can spend Rands (`R900–R1,300`, no die required) at Golden Dragon Cyber-Pawn (`n5`), Queen Street Taxi Rank (`n2`), or The Ridge Penthouses (`n8`) to permanently boost stats and Composure.

3. **Two-Act Campaign & Segmented Clocks (`action`, `threat`, `world`)**:
   - **Act 1 — *The Ghost Docket* (7 CBD & Harbour Nodes, `n1`–`n7`)**:
     - **Threat Clocks**: *Brigadier Mokoena's Sweep* (`0/6`, `+1 / Cycle`), *Nandi's Gunshot Wound* (`0/4`, `+1 / Cycle`), *Precinct Heat* (`0/6`, `On Heat`).
     - **Investigation Clocks**: *Audit Docket #409* (`0/4`), *Crack Auditor's Handset* (`0/4`).
     - **World Finale Clock**: *Berth 14 Precursor Convoy* (`0/4`, `+1 / Cycle` toward `evt_climax_berth14` and 4 Act 1 endings).
   - **Act 2 — *The Commission of Inquiry* (5 Upper Ridge, Midlands & Tarmac Nodes, `n8`–`n12`)**:
     - Carries over Stats, Cash, Faction Standing, and Black-Market Gear from any surviving Act 1 ending (`ending_vigilante`, `ending_whistleblower`, `ending_kingpin`), plus a path-specific Legacy Dossier Item (`+1 STREET`, `+1 DOCKETS`, or `+R1,500`).
     - **Threat Clocks**: *Izinkabi Hit Squad* (`0/6`, `+1 / Cycle`), *Contempt & Security Warrant* (`0/6`, `On Heat`).
     - **Investigation Clocks**: *Trace Sovereign Pearl Trust* (`0/4`), *Synthesize Super-Lab Telemetry* (`0/4`).
     - **World Finale Clock**: *Flight ZS-900 Charter Departure* (`0/4`, `+1 / Cycle` toward `evt_act2_climax_tarmac` at King Shaka Hangar 7 and 4 Act 2 Grand Finale endings).

4. **Rolling Blackouts (Load Shedding Grid) & Generator Override**:
   - Rotates across Stages `2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2` each cycle.
   - **Stage 6 Lockouts**: Disables server-reliant slots (`disabledDuringStage6: true`) at City Hall Annex, Golden Dragon Cyber-Pawn, The Ridge Penthouses, and High Court Chambers unless the player spends `R300` on **Backup Generator Diesel** (`generatorActiveToday`) or triggers the City Hall **Grid Manipulation** perk.
   - **Stage 6 Cover Bonus**: Grants `+2` roll modifiers (`stage6BonusModifier: 2`) to covert infiltration actions at Pier 2 Cold Storage (`n6`), Hydroponic Citrus Estate (`n11`), and King Shaka Cargo Apron (`n12`).

5. **SAPS Roadblocks, Hostile Turf & Faction Standing Perks**:
   - **Roadblock Intercepts**: When Heat/Contempt $\ge 4$ or Sweep/Hit Squad $\ge 5$, primary transit corridors lock down. Travelling across a blocked corridor requires paying a `R200` "cold drink" bribe or burning `1 Unused Die` to detour—unless the player holds the cloned `saps_radio_scanner` or has `street_syndicate` Rep $\ge 2$.
   - **Hostile Turf Retaliation**: Operating on a node owned by a faction with `Rep <= -2` imposes a `-1 Hostile Turf Roll Penalty`.
   - **1/Day Tactical Faction Perks** (`usedPerksToday`):
     - `perk_grid_manipulation` (*City Hall Rep $\ge 1$*): Toggle Load Shedding between Stage 2 and Stage 6 on demand.
     - `perk_bluelight_escort` (*SAPS TRT Rep $\ge 1$*): Scrub vehicle plates (`-2 Heat/Contempt`, `-1 Sweep/Hit Squad`).
     - `perk_izinkabi_muscle` (*Street Syndicate Rep $\ge 2$, costs R600*): Upgrade lowest unused die to a `6`.
     - `perk_hawks_safechannel` (*Hawks Rep $\ge 2$*): Counter-surveillance briefing (`+15% Composure`, `-1 Sweep/Hit Squad`).

## Multilingual Localization Architecture (10 South African Languages)

Mzansi Midnight features deep, zero-compromise localization across **all 10 official South African regional languages**:
- `en` — English (Master Canonical Source — 1,836 keys)
- `zu` — isiZulu (1,836 keys)
- `xh` — isiXhosa (1,836 keys)
- `af` — Afrikaans (1,836 keys)
- `st` — Sesotho (1,836 keys)
- `nso` — Sepedi / Northern Sotho (1,836 keys)
- `tn` — Setswana (1,836 keys)
- `ts` — Xitsonga (1,836 keys)
- `ss` — Siswati (1,836 keys)
- `ve` — Tshivenḓa (1,836 keys)

### Dual-Layer Translation Strategy
1. **Direct Structured Key Lookup (`t(key, fallback, lang)`)**:
   Used for static UI labels, tutorial guidance, modal headers, button text, and structured data properties (`node.n1_safehouse.title`, `dialogue.n1_safehouse.role`, etc.).
2. **Reverse English Value Mapping (`EN_REVERSE_MAP` & `getLocalizedTextByEnglishValue(text, lang)`)**:
   Enables dynamic translation of computed strings, dialogue reward summaries (e.g. `"+1 Audit Docket #409 Clock, +10% Composure"`), and NPC stage directions / speaker moods without refactoring the underlying numeric state engine.
3. **Retrospective Narrative Log Translation (`getLocalizedLogEntry(entry, lang)`)**:
   Translates dynamic active log entries (e.g. `"[Phonsa 6 -> 8] Cross-Reference Docket #409: ..."` or `"You spot it immediately..."`) retroactively when the player switches languages mid-campaign, maintaining a localized crime comms ledger.

For complete developer guidelines on authoring new narrative campaigns or expanding existing stories, see [`docs/STORY_TRANSLATION_BLUEPRINT.md`](file:///c:/Users/Faiz/Documents/workspaces/mzansi-midnight/docs/STORY_TRANSLATION_BLUEPRINT.md).
