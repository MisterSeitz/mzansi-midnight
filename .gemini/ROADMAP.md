# Mzansi Midnight (`eThekwini-Gold`) — Development Roadmap

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: World-Building, Genre & Systems Design ✅
- [x] Defined the **Dice-and-Node Noir RPG** core loop (Daily Composure-driven `d6` pool, deterministic stat + blackout roll previews, segmented clocks).
- [x] Designed the **South African setting ("eThekwini-Gold")** blending Durban port logistics with Johannesburg brutalist verticality and state-capture mechanics.
- [x] Established the **4-Stat Investigator System** (`street`, `dockets`, `wire`, `influence`) and **5 Interlocking Factions** (`abasanta`, `city_hall`, `saps_trt`, `street_syndicate`, `hawks`).
- [x] Mapped the **7 Act 1 CBD & Waterfront Nodes** across three sectors (West Street Grid, Central Civic Spine, East Harbour Channel).

### Phase 2: Core TypeScript State Engine & Data Model ✅
- [x] Created framework-agnostic TypeScript interfaces in `types/game.ts`, `types/events.ts`, and `types/prologue.ts`.
- [x] Implemented `initialGameState` in `data/initialState.ts` with all 7 Act 1 nodes, SVG percentage coordinates, Stage 6 Load Shedding lockouts/bonuses, and action slots.
- [x] Implemented pure turn-resolution functions `resolveActionSlot` and `advanceToNextDay` in `engine/resolver.ts`.
- [x] Implemented `resolveTriggeredEvent` in `engine/eventResolver.ts` for queued crisis and breakthrough events.

### Phase 3: Interactive Prologue & Event Deck ✅
- [x] Authored the 4-beat interactive prologue (`data/prologueScript.ts` & `components/PrologueScreen.tsx`) featuring 3 selectable Hawks investigator backgrounds:
  - *The Paper-Trail Auditor* (`+2 Dockets, +1 Influence`)
  - *The Burned Enforcer* (`+2 Street, +1 Dockets`)
  - *The Ghost Wiretapper* (`+2 Wire, +1 Influence`)
- [x] Built the Act 1 Event Deck (`data/eventDeck.ts` & `components/EventModal.tsx`):
  - Threat Crises: *Blue Lights in the Alley* (`evt_trt_safehouse_raid`), *Septic Shock* (`evt_nandi_critical`), *Operation Shanela Lockdown* (`evt_shanela_roadblock`).
  - Investigation Breakthroughs: *The Water-Tanker Pipeline* (`evt_docket_decoded`), *Voice Note from Berth 14* (`evt_phone_decrypted`).

### Phase 4: Tactical SVG District Map & Single-Screen HUD ✅
- [x] Scaffolded the Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS application in the workspace.
- [x] Built `SegmentedClock` (`components/ThreatClock.tsx`) for 4, 6, 8, and 12-segment circular SVG clocks.
- [x] Built `DistrictSvgMap` (`components/DistrictSvgMap.tsx`) with transit corridors, dynamic SAPS roadblock indicators, Stage 6 power/darkness badges, and fog-of-war locked location leads.
- [x] Built `GameDashboard` (`components/GameDashboard.tsx`) with dual drag-and-drop / click-to-assign dice placement, live roll outcome color previews, Faction Standing panel, and Evidence Inventory.

### Phase 5: Act 1 Climax & Ending Paths ✅
- [x] Added the 4-segment `berth_14_countdown` World Clock and Finale Action Slots on Pier 2 Cold Storage (`n6_pier2_port`) and The Old Archive Basement (`n7_archive_basement`).
- [x] Built the **Midnight at Berth 14 (`evt_climax_berth14`)** showdown event and HUD trigger button.
- [x] Authored 4 complete Act 1 Endings in `data/endings.ts` and built the full-screen `EndingScreen` (`components/EndingScreen.tsx`) with epilogue narrative, district power-shift cards, final fixer ledger, and timeline reset:
  - **The Vigilante Path** (`ending_vigilante` — *"The Harbour Fire"*)
  - **The Whistleblower Path** (`ending_whistleblower` — *"Front Page of The Daily Veld"*)
  - **The Kingpin Path** (`ending_kingpin` — *"Twenty Percent of the Taps"*)
  - **Systemic Failure** (`ending_captured` — *"Buried in Shaft 9"*)

---

### Phase 6: Deepening Systemic Mechanics ✅
- [x] **Roadblock Travel Enforcement**: Require spending `1 Die` or `R200` "cold drink" bribe when switching between nodes separated by an active SAPS Roadblock, unless the player holds the cloned SAPS transponder (`saps_radio_scanner`) or `street_syndicate` Rep >= 2.
- [x] **Unlockable Faction Perks** (1/day tactical abilities in Left Panel):
  - *City Hall Rep >= 1*: **Grid Manipulation** (toggle Load Shedding between Stage 2 and Stage 6 on demand).
  - *SAPS TRT Rep >= 1*: **Blue-Light Escort** (clear `-2 Precinct Heat` and `-1 Mokoena's Sweep`).
  - *Street Syndicate Rep >= 2*: **Izinkabi Muscle** (spend `R600` to upgrade lowest unused die to a `6`).
  - *Hawks Rep >= 2*: **Hawks Safe-Channel** (recover `+15% Composure` and `-1 Mokoena's Sweep`).
- [x] **Generator Diesel Consumable**: Allow purchasing backup generator diesel (`R300`) during Stage 6 Load Shedding to override `disabledDuringStage6` server lockouts for the current cycle.

### Phase 7: Polish, Persistence, Audio Atmosphere & FAL.ai Visual Assets ✅
- [x] **AI Visual Asset Generation (`FAL_API_KEY`)**: Created `scripts/generate-assets.mjs` and generated 15 custom South African graphic-novel noir illustrations (`public/assets/backgrounds/*.jpg`, `public/assets/characters/*.jpg`, `public/assets/nodes/*.jpg`) integrated across `PrologueScreen`, `GameDashboard`, and `EventModal`.
- [x] **Local Storage Save/Load**: Auto-save `GameState` and `inPrologue` to `localStorage` (`mzansi_midnight_save_v1`) on every action and cycle transition, with a `RESET` timeline button in the Top HUD.
- [x] **Dice Roll & Blackout Micro-Animations**: Added dice-tumbling animation (`isRollingDice`) and grid-power transition flicker (`isGridFlashing`) on "End Cycle / Sleep".
- [x] **Web Audio Synth / Ambient Soundscape (`engine/soundscape.ts`)**: Procedural coastal rain loop, 55Hz Eskom substation transformer hum, tabletop dice clicks, harmonic roll outcome chords, and crisis alert tones with a Top HUD `AUDIO: ON / MUTED` toggle.
- [x] **Onboarding, Intro Briefing & In-Game Guidance**:
  - `components/TitleIntroScreen.tsx`: Cinematic title screen, 3-pillar "How the City Works" briefing, and Resume / Play Prologue / Quick-Start buttons.

  - `components/GameDashboard.tsx`: Dynamic viewport height (`h-[100dvh]`), compact 2-row mobile header, 3-Tab Mobile Tactical Switcher (`1. District Map`, `2. Node Actions`, `3. Clocks & Turf`), one-thumb "Inspect Node" CTA bar, and persistent bottom Dice Dock that auto-switches to the `actions` tab when a die is tapped on mobile.
  - `components/DistrictSvgMap.tsx`: Touch-scrollable mobile quick-select Node Pill Strip (`lg:hidden`) and responsive node pin cards (`w-28 sm:w-40 lg:w-56`).
  - Scroll-safe modals (`max-h-[90dvh] overflow-y-auto`, `min-h-[100dvh]`) across `EventModal`, `TutorialOverlay`, `TitleIntroScreen`, `PrologueScreen`, and `EndingScreen`.

---

### Phase 8: Systemic Edge Cases, Dossier Reader & Morning Wires ✅
- [x] **Zero-Composure Breakdown Crisis (`0% Composure` Consequence)**:
  - Triggers **"Blackout Paranoia: Nervous Collapse" (`evt_composure_breakdown`)** when Composure drops to `0%`, forcing the player to spend `R500` on black-market stimulants (`+45% Composure, +1 Precinct Heat`), call a Hawks medic (`Hawks Rep >= 1` for `+50% Composure, -1 Sweep`), or pass out (`+35% Composure`, advancing Threat Clocks).
- [x] **Interactive Evidence Dossier & Item Inspection Modal (`data/itemsCatalog.ts` & `components/EvidenceDossierModal.tsx`)**:
  - Clicking any item in `Evidence & Gear Dossier` opens a classified Hawks Dossier reader displaying the item's source, forensic document/audio transcript excerpt, and mechanical utility.
- [x] **Encrypted Morning Briefings & Daily Street Events (`data/eventDeck.ts` & `engine/resolver.ts`)**:

- [x] **Custom Main Menu Key Art & Complete NPC Portrait Set (`FAL_API_KEY`)**:
  - Generated widescreen noir title key art (`public/assets/backgrounds/title_keyart.jpg`) and the remaining NPC portraits (`masibi.jpg`, `vandermerwe.jpg`, `sparks.jpg`) so all 7 Act 1 nodes and all 5 factions have dedicated character portraits (18 custom `.jpg` assets total).
