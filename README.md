> *"A country where the power cuts out at 20:00, the water runs dry by Tuesday, and the bank accounts in Dubai fill up by midnight. Every province has its own poison, but they all drink from the same cup."*

## 🎲 The 5-Part Campaign Anthology

The quintet spans the geopolitical fractures of South Africa. Each story features its own **regional hub**, **protagonist archetype**, **interactive district map**, **segmented threat clocks**, and **faction dynamics**. Each chapter unlocks sequentially through Keystone Dossier extraction, culminating in a national convergence on the Union Buildings:

## ⚡ Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Daily Action Dice & Composure Engine**: Each Cycle (Day), roll 3 to 5 d6 dice based on your Composure percentage (`80–100%` = 5 dice, `40–79%` = 4 dice, `<40%` = 3 dice).
- **Deterministic Outcome Tiers**:
  - `6+`: **Clean Success** (+2 clock progress, maximum rewards, zero trace).
  - `4–5`: **Compromised Success** (+1 clock progress, minor Composure or Heat penalty).
  - `1–3`: **Failure / Blowback** (Composure damage, precinct heat, or threat clock acceleration).
- **Four Core Investigator Stats (`-1` to `+3+`)**:
  - `street`: Physical intimidation, taxi rank politics, surviving ambushes, raw force.
  - `dockets`: Forensic accounting, municipal registry audits, certified court records.
  - `wire`: Signals intelligence, biometric lock bypassing, radio transponder interception.
  - `influence`: Inside game, bribing magistrates, leveraging political blackmail.
- **Rolling Blackouts (Eskom Load Shedding Grid)**:
  - Rotates between Stages `2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2` each cycle.
  - **Stage 6 Lockouts**: Forensic servers and cyber pawn terminals lose power unless you burn **Backup Generator Diesel** or activate grid override perks.
  - **Stage 6 Cover**: Infiltration and stealth operations receive a `+2` roll modifier in darkness.
- **SAPS Roadblocks & Hostile Turf**:
  - High heat locks down transit corridors, demanding cold drink bribes or detour dice burns.
  - Factions hostile to you (`Rep <= -2`) impose a `-1` turf roll penalty.
- **Procedural Soundscape**:
  - Zero-dependency Web Audio synthesizer generating filtered coastal rain, 55Hz Eskom transformer hum that shifts pitch during Stage 6 blackouts, dice roll physics, and alert stings.
- **Interactive Conspiracy Board**:
  - Forensic red-string corkboard dynamically tracking suspects, shell trusts, bank records, and keystone dossiers.
